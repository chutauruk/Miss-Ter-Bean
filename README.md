# Miss-Ter-Bean

Attempting to embed images in README.md file for convenient reference.

Exclamation Method

HTML Method

Challenges:
Visualizing amount of boxes to use. Initially, I wanted to do 2 split nested div tables and nest header, image, and button in the first table; while nesting navbar, diy recipe, store locator, event calendar, and order here in the second table. Once I reviewed from YouTube regarding CSS Grid Layout Crash Course by Traversy Media, I realized I can split two into box 4 and two into box 5.

Also, exclamation method did not embed the wireframe image.

Victories:
Getting my button quote generator to work which was one of the main objectives of this assignment. Also, getting it to place properly on the site.
